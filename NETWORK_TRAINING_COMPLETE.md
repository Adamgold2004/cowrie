  - `traffic_patterns.json` - Sample network flow patterns
  - `training_summary.txt` - Human-readable summary

### 3. **Enhanced Cowrie Modules**
- ✅ **Network Training Module** (`src/cowrie/output/network_training.py`):
  - Real-time threat level assessment using actual attack data
  - Port risk scoring based on attack frequencies from your dataset
  - Attack pattern recognition for port scanning detection
  - Automated response recommendations
  - Enhanced logging with attack context

  - Added network training module configuration
  - Enabled enhanced threat detection capabilities

### 4. **Advanced Threat Detection Features**

#### 🔴 **Critical Risk Ports** (>500 attacks in dataset):
- **Port 53 (DNS)**: 2,460 attacks - Immediate blocking recommended
- **Port 443 (HTTPS)**: 859 attacks - High-priority monitoring
- **Port 80 (HTTP)**: 632 attacks - Enhanced logging required

#### 🟡 **Medium Risk Ports** (20-100 attacks):
- Port 22 (SSH): 25 attacks - Brute force monitoring
- Port 21 (FTP): 21 attacks - Legacy service alerts
- Port 123 (NTP): 95 attacks - Time service monitoring

#### 🛡️ **Enhanced Security Capabilities**:
- **Real-time Risk Scoring**: 0-100 scale based on actual attack data
- **Attack Pattern Recognition**: Port scanning, reconnaissance, brute force
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Quick disconnects, version probing, failed logins
- **Automated Recommendations**: Block IPs, increase monitoring, alert teams
